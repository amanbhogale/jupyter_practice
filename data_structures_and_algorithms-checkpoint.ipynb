    "#### Data Structures (Part I): Introduction\n",
    "Here we survey Python’s built-in data structures. You should already be familiar with its lists and tuples, two data structures that facilitate working with sequential data. Two other critical, built-in data structures to be introduced are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* dictionary: a mapping from “keys” to “values”\n",
    "\n",
    "* sets: an unordered collection of items that can be used to perform set-algebraic operations (e.g. union and intersection)\n",
    "\n",
    "These data structures are not merely convenient constructs with some nice pre-written functionality; they also provide an interface to some optimized core utilities that have been written in C (or whatever language your Python interpreter is written in). For example, let’s write a function that checks if an item is contained within an iterable:"
