# Experiment 1: Supervised learning regression:
**Aim**: 
1. Generate a proper 2-D data set of N points. ✅
2. Split the data set into Training Data set and Test Data set. ✅
3. Perform linear regression analysis with Least Squares Method. ✅
4. Plot the graphs for Training MSE and Test MSE and comment on Curve Fitting and Generalization Error. ✅
5. Verify the Effect of Data Set Size and Bias-Variance Tradeoff. 
6. Apply Cross Validation and plot the graphs for errors. 
7. Apply Subset Selection Method and plot the graphs for errors. 
8. Describe your findings in each case.
